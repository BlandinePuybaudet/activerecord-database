#Interacting with a DB with code

* In this exercice, we are going to do the same thing as the previous one, but with Ruby (instead of the command line tool)

* For that we use a gem call sqlite3 [http://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3](http://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3)

	````
	gem install sqlite3
	````

## Obectives

* The goal is to query the Chinook database with Ruby

## Exercice

#### Write a code in ruby that answers the following questions:

* How many tables does the Chinook database contain ?
* How many artists are there in the Artist table ?
* How many tracks are there in the Track table ?


## Tip

* Your code should `require 'sqlite3'"`
* You can reuse the queries you made in the previous exercise.
