You will add database validations for your Cookbook.

What is a database validation ?

A database validation is a rule that ensures that your data is consistent and valid.

## To do:

Writes database validation to:

0. Make sure all fields in recipes and users are required
1. Make sure that name is unique for recipes. (i.e you cannot have two recipes with the same name in your cookbok)
2. Make sure email is unique for users
3. Make sure email is valid (xxxx@xxxx.xxx)
4. Make sure difficulty of recipes is between 1 and 5

Test your validation by trying to create duplicated recipes or users, or users with invalid email, or recipes with invalid difficulty.
