## Objective

You will build a Cookbook database that contains recipes. And you will code a program than can Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes from the database.

You will start with a simple model:

* The cookbook database contains Recipes and Chefs
* A Chef has an Unique Id (Integer) and a Name (String)
* A Recipe has an Unique Id (Integer) and a Name (String) 
* A Chef can create many recipes.
* A recipe belongs to a Chef


## Exercice

Build a program that:

1. Creates a database called Cookbook
2. Run a SQL queries to create the tables Recipes and Chefs
3. Writes functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes and chefs


##Writes functions that:

###Creates an new chef
	
````ruby	
def create_chef(name)
  	# your code here
end		
````


###Creates a recipe

````ruby
def create_recipe(chef_id,name)
  # your code here
end
````


###Updates a chef name

````ruby
def update_chef(id,name)
  # your code here
end
````


###Updates a recipe

````ruby
def update_recipe(id,name)
 # your code here
end
````

###Gets all the chefs

````ruby
def get_chefs()
  # your code here
end
````

###Gets all the recipes

````ruby
def get_recipes()
 # your code here
end
````

###Deletes a chef (and all his recipes)

````ruby
def delete_chef(id)
  # your code here
end
````

###Deletes a recipe

````ruby
def delete_recipe(id)
  # your code here
end
````
