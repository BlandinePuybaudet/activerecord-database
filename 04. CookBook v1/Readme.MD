##Obectives

You are going to rebuild your Cookbook database, but now using ActiveRecord, and you will find out how it makes your life much easier.


##Goal

Design the Cookbook database, and build the functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete Recipes and Chefs.

###Reminder

* The cookbook database contains Recipes
* A Recipe has:
	* name:string 
	* description:string 
	* length:integer (minutes) 
	* difficulty:integer 
	
###Exercise

1. The goal of this exercise is to build a little program with Active Record that can Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes.

To help you started, we already prepared a skeleton app for you! (04. CookBook folder)
