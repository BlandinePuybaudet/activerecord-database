##Obectives

You are going to rebuild your Cookbook database, but now using ActiveRecord, and you will find out how it makes your life much easier.


##Goal

Design the Cookbook database, and build the functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete Recipes and Chefs.

###Reminder

* The cookbook database contains Recipes and Chefs
* A Chef has an Unique Id (Integer) and a Name (String)
* A Recipe has an Unique Id (Integer) and a Name (String) 
* A Chef can create many recipes.
* A recipe belongs to a Chef


###Exercise

1. The goal of this exercise is to build a little program with Active Record that can Create, Read, Update and Delete Chefs and Recipes.

To help you started, we already prepared a skeleton app for you! (04. CookBook folder)
