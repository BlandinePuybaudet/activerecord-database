Since now you are an expert in SQL queries, let's get ourselves a little break and 

You will build a Cookbook database that contains recipes. And you will code a program than can Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes from the database.

You will start with a simple model:

* The cookbook database contains Recipes
* A Recipe has:
	* name:string 
	* description:string 
	* length:integer (minutes) 
	* difficulty:integer 


## Exercice

Build a program that:

1. Creates a database called Cookbook
2. Run a SQL queries to create the Recipes table
3. Writes functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes

## Writes functions that:

### Creates a recipe

````ruby
def create_recipe(hash)
  # your code here
end
````

### Updates a recipe

````ruby
def update_recipe(hash)
 # your code here
end
````

### Gets all the recipes

````ruby
def get_recipes()
 # your code here
end
````

### Deletes a recipe

````ruby
def delete_recipe(id)
  # your code here
end
````
